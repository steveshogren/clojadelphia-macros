No, Really, Learning Clojure Was Hard!

Everyone says Clojure is simple and easy, right? "I'll just quick learn it over
the weekend!" So started the hardest two weeks of my development career. Two
weeks later, I was still struggling with basics. Each line of code was a battle
to comprehend all the new concepts. S-expressions? Macros? Wait, you can say
(:key map) AND (map :key)?! In hindsight, it looks so easy, the code legible.
But when we forget how difficult it can be, we trivialize a new learner's
struggles. We have to remember: sometimes learning Clojure is not easy.
