Agile Testing Days --
Clip: 
How do you build an adaptive Enterprise team that can rapidly build high-quality features that will withstand a decade of change? Two things: one, hire great people. Two, feel entirely out of control as you entrust and empower them to meet the business's needs. In this talk I will share lessons learned from a decade of self-organizing teams practicing TDD and pair-programming. Join me in observing how we built and maintain a 4 and a half million line codebase. We will talk about how you can build such a team, and the potential challenges you will face as you lead your teams to success.

How do you build an adaptive Enterprise team that can rapidly build high-quality features that will withstand a decade of change? You hire great people, and empower them to meet the business's needs. In this talk I will share lessons learned from a decade of self-organizing teams practicing TDD and pair-programming. Join me in observing how we built and maintain a 4.3 million line codebase. We will talk about how you can build such a team, and the potential challenges you will face as you lead your teams to success.

Our office was founded on the principals of XP and self-organization. Over the
last decade, we have built the industry-leading software for bank collateral
management. Our developers are empowered to organize around the needs of the
business. Self-organization and intrinsic motivation allow each individual to
rapidly mature. As a group, we continue to vote to re-adopt pair-programming and
TDD as foundational pillars of our practice. We have rich co-op program that
feeds our teams with the best university graduates.
