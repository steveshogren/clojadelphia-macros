* Intro
** Have you ever seen a Java/Ruby/C#/Python application? 
*** Clojure will be 99% the same architecture!
** I remember being totally stumped by immutability
*** How would anything be possible with that restriction?
**** If you want to mutate state, just pass it in and out!
**** vars, refs, regular Java data structures, etc
* A Basic Command-line Application
** A regular JVM main function by any other name
When making a command-line application, you define an entry-point, then have
functions call other functions until you have finished processing the input. Any
output is displayed. Finally control is returned to the OS by returning from
that entry function. Clojure command line applications are no different.
** Uses tools-cli for parsing
* A Basic Web Application
** How would we make it, knowing Java?
** Surely the Clojure application will look similar...
** Uses Luminus for "working example"
* A Bigger Web Application
** Uses compojure for routing and ring handling
* BONUS ROUND A Persistent Game
** A regular JVM main function by any other name
** Uses tools-cli for parsing
