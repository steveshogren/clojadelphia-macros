No, Really, Learning Clojure Was Hard!

"Rich Hickey and Paul Graham are so awesome and smart; Clojure and Lisp are
their secret weapons! I'm awesome and smart too, this should be easy! Rich even
said Clojure is easy, right?"

So started the hardest two weeks of my development career.

You may conclude that I am not smart and that Clojure is actually easy. And
you'd probably be right. But, starting out, my expectations were set all wrong.

I'd worked professionally in Python, PHP, Perl, and Java. I expected to be able
to drop in and rewrite my pet PHP project in Clojure over a couple weeks. 



Saying "oh, that's
easy, just...", we make them feel inadequate for not seeing it. Our empathy for
their struggle can make the difference between them giving up because "everyone
else says this is easy, I must be dumb" and them powering through.


Everyone says Clojure is simple and easy, right? "I'll just quick learn it over the weekend!" So started the hardest two weeks of my development career. Two weeks later, I was still struggling with basics. Each line of code was a battle to comprehend all the new concepts. S-expressions? Macros? Wait, you can say (:key map) AND (map :key)?! In hindsight, it looks so easy, the code legible. But when we forget how difficult it can be, we trivialize a new learner's struggles. We have to remember: sometimes learning Clojure is not easy.

Notes

I feel like the Clojure community has a persistent external meme that Clojure is
"easy to learn". Powerful tools are not always easy to learn. I want this talk
to be a reminder to everyone of their personal learning struggles. Syntactic
macros, immutability, ParEdit, Cider, and STM - these are very powerful tools.
They are also difficult to learn, and we've all likely wrestled with them at
some point.

My goal will be to relate my experiences in those first few weeks to those of
the audience. I'll advocate for their empathy towards learners, and suggest
several concrete strategies for improving any conversations they have with
beginners.


Outline: 
(10 min) Intro - Imagine you've just accomplished a challenging goal.
You tell someone and they reply, "oh, that, meh, it was easy for me".

(10 min) Explain personal learning journey - 170 hours of lisp before it felt
comfortable, 420 before I suggested we use it at work.

(10 min) Concrete suggestions for interacting with learners of any skill level:
don't trivialize their struggles, always celebrate their triumphs, don't just
tell them the answer.

(10 min) Conclusion - Celebrate the Struggle!
